Casy looked shyly at him. “If it hits you wrong, don’t take no offense at it, will you?”
“I don’t take no offense ‘cept a bust in the nose,” said Joad. “What did you figger?”
“I figgered about the Holy Sperit and the Jesus road. I figgered, maybe it’s all men an’ all women we love; maybe that’s the Holy Sperit – the huyman sperit – the whole shebang. Maybe I sat there thinkin' it, soul ever’body’s a part of.’ Now I sat there thinkin’ it. An’ all of a sudden – I knew it so deep down that it was true, and I still know it.”
Joad’s eyes dropped to the ground as though he could not meet the naked honesty in the preacher’s eyes. “You can’t hold  no church with idears like that,” he said. “People would drive you out of the country with idears like that. Jumpin’ an yellin’. That’s what folks like. Makes ‘em feel swell. When Granma got to talkin’ in tongues, you couldn’t tie her down. She could knock over s full-growed deacon with her first.”
Casy regarded him broodingly. “Somepin I like to ast you, “ he said,” Somepin that been eatin’ on me.”
“Go ahead. I’ll talk, sometimes.”
“Well” – the preacher said slowly – “here’s you that I baptized right when I was in the glory roof-tree. Got little hunks of Jesus jumpin’ outa my mouth that day. You won’t remember ‘cause you was busy pullin’ that pigtail.”
“I remember,” said Joad. “That was Susy Little. She bust my finger a year later.”
“Well – did you take any good outa that baptizin’? Was your ways better?”
Joad thought about it. “No-o-o, can’t say as I felt anything.”
“Well – did you take any bad from it? Think hard.”
Joad picked up the bottle and took a swig. “They wasn’t nothing in it, good or bad. I just had fun.” He handed the flask to the preacher.
He sighed and drank and looked at the low level of the whisky and took another tiny drink. “That’s good,” he said. “I got to worryin’ about whether in messin’ around maybe I done somebody a hurt.”
Joad looked over forward his coat and saw the turtle, free of the cloth and hurrying away in the direction he had been following when Joad found him. Joad watched him for a moment and then got slowly to his feet and retrieved him and wrapped him in the coat again. "I ain't got no present for the kids," he said. "Nothin' but this ol' turtle."
"It's a funny thing," the preacher said. "I was thinkin' about ol' Tom Joad when you come along. "Thinkin' I'd call in on him. I used to think he was a godless man. How is Tom?"
"I don't know how he is. I ain't been home in four years."
"Didn't he write to you?"
Joad was embarrassed. "Well, Pa wasn't no hand to write for pretty, or to write for writin'. He'd sign up his name as nice as anybody, an' lick his pencil. But Pa never did write no letters. He always says what he couldn't tell a fella with his mouth wasn't worth leanin' on no pencil abut,"
Been out travelin' around?" Casy asked.
Joad regarded him suspiciously. "Didn't you hear about me? I was in all the papers."
"No - I never. What?" He jerked one leg over the other and settled lower against the tree. The afternoon was advancing rapidly, and a richer tone was growing on the sun.
